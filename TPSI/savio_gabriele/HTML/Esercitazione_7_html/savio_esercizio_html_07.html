          <h2>Loopback</h2>
          <p>
            The <q><strong>loopback</strong></q> mechanism can be used to run a network
            service on a host without requiring a physical network interface, or
            without making the service accessible from the networks to which the
            computer may be connected. For example, a locally installed website
            can be accessed from a web browser via the URL
            <u>http://localhost</u> to view its home page. The name
            <strong>localhost</strong> normally resolves to the loopback address
            <strong>IPv4</strong> <small>127.0.0.1</small>, and to the loopback
            address <small>IPv6</small> ::1.

    <h2>Name Resolution</h2>
    <p>
      Network standards<abbr title="Internet Protocol version 4"></abbr><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4">IPv4</a></abbr>reserve the entire
      block of addresses 127.0.0.0/8 (over 16 million addresses) for loopback
      purposes. This means that any packet sent to one of those addresses is
      returned. The address <ins>127.0.0.1</ins> is the standard address for
      IPv4 loopback traffic; the rest are not supported by all operating
      systems. However, they can be used to configure multiple server
      applications on the host, all listening on the same port number. The
      <abbr title="Internet Protocol version 6"></abbr><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a></abbr> standard assigns
      only a single address for loopback: <strong>::1</strong>.
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>127.0.0.1</td>
        <td><del>localhost</del></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>::1</td>
        <td><del>localhost</del></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      The name can also be resolved by
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System"
        >Domain Name System</a
      >
      (DNS), but queries for this name should be resolved locally and should not
      be forwarded to remote name servers.
      <br />
      <small>In addition</small> to mapping localhost to loopback addresses
      (127.0.0.1 and ::1), localhost can also be mapped to other
      <strong>IPv4</strong> (loopback) addresses and it is also possible to
      assign other names to any loopback address. Mapping localhost to addresses
      other than those designated in the loopback address range in the hosts
      file or in DNS is not guaranteed to have the desired effect, as
      applications may map the name internally.
    </p>

    <div>
      In the Domain Name System, the name <strong>localhost</strong> is reserved
      as a top-level domain name, originally set aside to avoid confusion with
      the host name used for loopback purposes. <abbr title="Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</abbr> standards prohibit domain
      name registrars from assigning the name <strong>localhost</strong>.
    </div>

    <h2>IETF Standards</h2>
    <p>
      The name localhost is reserved for loopback purposes by <cite>RFC 6761 (Special Use Domain Names)</cite>
      , which reached Proposed Standard maturity in February
      2013. The standard establishes a series of special considerations
      governing the use of the name in the Domain Name System:
      <br />
      An <small>IPv4</small> or <small>IPv6</small> address query for the name
      <strong>localhost</strong> must always resolve to the respective loopback
      address, which is specified in a separate standard.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Applications can resolve the name to a loopback address on their own,
          or pass it to local name resolution mechanisms. When a name resolver
          receives an address (A or AAAA) query for <strong>localhost</strong>,
          it should return the appropriate loopback addresses and negative
          responses for any other type of record requested. Queries for
          localhost should not be sent to cached name servers. To avoid
          burdening the root servers of the Domain Name System with traffic,
          cached name servers should never request name server records for
          <strong>localhost</strong> or forward resolution to authoritative name
          servers. DNS registrars are excluded from delegating domain names in
          the top-level domain <strong>localhost</strong>. When authoritative
          name servers receive queries for <strong>localhost</strong> despite
          the aforementioned provisions, they must resolve them appropriately.
          Loopback addresses <strong>IPv4</strong> are reserved within the IPv4
          address space by the IETF "Special Use IPv4 Address Standard" (RFC
          5735). The reservation can be traced back to the
          <ins>November</ins> 1986 standard "Assigned Numbers" (RFC 990).

          <h2>Packet Processing</h2>
          <p>
            The processing of any packet sent to a loopback address is
            implemented at the link layer of the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite"
              >TCP/IP stack</a
            >. Such packets are never passed to any network interface controller
            <span>(NIC)</span> or hardware device driver and should not appear
            outside of a computer system, nor be routed by any router. This
            allows for software testing and local services in the absence of
            hardware network interfaces.
            <br />
            Loopback packets are distinguished from any other packets traversing
            the TCP/IP stack only by the special IP address to which they were
            directed. <strong>Therefore</strong>, services that receive them
            respond according to the specified destination. For example, an HTTP
            service might route packets directed to <ins>127.0.0.99:80</ins> and
            <ins>127.0.0.100:80</ins> to different web servers, or to a single
            server that returns different web pages. To simplify such testing,
            the hosts file can be configured to provide appropriate names for
            each address.
          </p>

          <div>
            Packets received on a non-loopback interface with a loopback source
            or destination address must be discarded. Such packets are sometimes
            referred to as <strong>Martian</strong> packets. As with any other
            bogus packet, they can be harmful, and any problems they might cause
            can be avoided by applying bogon filtering.

    <h2>Special Cases</h2>
    <p>
      Versions of the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySQL</a> database
      differentiate between using the hostname <ins>localhost</ins> and using
      the addresses <ins>127.0.0.1</ins> and <ins>::1</ins>. When using
      localhost as a destination in a client connector interface of an
      application, the MySQL application programming interface connects to the
      database using a Unix domain socket, while a TCP connection through the
      loopback interface requires the direct use of the explicit address.
      <br />
      A notable exception to the use of addresses
      <strong>127.0.0.0/8</strong> is their use in error detection of
      Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) traceroute, where their non-routable
      property provides a convenient means to avoid delivering faulty packets to
      end users.
